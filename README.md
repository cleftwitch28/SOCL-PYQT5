## INTRODUCTION:
Humans can identify patterns and objects, such as a clock, a chair, a dog, or a cat. However, for a computational model, pattern analysis is a considerable challenge.
Using artificial intelligence (AI) makes it possible for computer systems to perform pattern recognition. However, it is necessary to develop models capable of learning.
Through these models, it is possible to achieve methods that align with how the human brain performs the analysis.
